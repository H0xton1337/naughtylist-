Racist - Automatically marked by TF2BD - Won't be getting removed don't hmu

Cheater - The chances of someone being marked as a cheater are VERY low, the only way it can happen is if you're saying you're cheating when you're not and your account is new and private, or if you do something stupid like setting your name as "OMEGATRONIC" and get auto marked by tf2bd - Won't be getting removed don't hmu

Suspicious - IF SOMEONE IS MARKED AS SUSPICIOUS IT DOESNT 100% MEAN THEY'RE CHEATING, I am certain there are legit players marked as suspicious on this list, If you have a new profile and I cannot tell if you're cheating or not you will most likely be marked as suspicious, hmu if belive you have been falsely marked as suspicious
